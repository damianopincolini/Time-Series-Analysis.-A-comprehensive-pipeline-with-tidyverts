# Time-Series-Analysis.-A-comprehensive-pipeline-with-tidyverts
This project demonstrates a complete time series forecasting pipeline using R's tidyverts ecosystem. Working with monthly airline baggage complaint data (2004-2010), I implement EDA, stationarity testing, Box-Cox transformation, and SARIMA modeling to decompose temporal patterns and forecast future values with ~9% MAPE.
